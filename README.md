tsreduce
========

tsreduce is a tool for performing aperture photometry on CCD time-series observations of variable stars. It is designed to integrate with the [Puoko-nui time-series photometer](http://pchote.github.io/Puoko-nui/), but is general enough to use with data from other instruments.

tsreduce allows for simple online reductions of data as it acquired, and more comprehensive offline analysis to optimise the signal extracted from CCD frames.

See INSTALL ([Ubuntu](https://github.com/pchote/tsreduce/blob/master/INSTALL.ubuntu), [Windows](https://github.com/pchote/tsreduce/blob/master/INSTALL.windows)) for instructions on compiling and running tsreduce, and the [Puoko-nui manual](http://pchote.github.io/Puoko-nui/images/manual-lowres.pdf) for an introduction on how to use the software.
